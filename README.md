# Optimal Experiment Design with Boscia

The repository for the "Solving the Optimal Experiment Design Problem with Mixed-Integer Convex Methods" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11200).

The experiment scripts are in the ODWB folder. The models and set-ups for the different solvers can be found in the source folder in the ODWB folder. 

The experiments are set up to be run on a cluster. If you want to test individual instances, you can use Julia's enviromental variables and call the *run_optimal_design.jl" file directly.
